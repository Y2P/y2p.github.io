There exist many approximate techniques, some deterministic (like conjugate gradient), some stochastic (like stochastic gradient descent). Among the latter, a new class of techniques uses Determinantal Point Processes (DPPs) to produce unbiased estimators of the solution. In particular, they can be used to perform Tikhonov regularization on graphs using random spanning forests, a specific DPP. While the unbiasedness of these algorithms is attractive, their variance can be high. We show here that variance can be reduced by combining the stochastic estimator with a deterministic gradient-descent step, while keeping the property of unbiasedness. We apply this technique to Tikhonov regularization on graphs, where the reduction in variance is found to be substantial at very small extra cost.","tags":null,"title":"Variance reduction in stochastic methods for large-scale regularised least-squares problems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusuf Yigit PILAVCI","Pierre-Olivier Amblard","Simon Barthelme","Nicolas Tremblay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1604188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1604188800,"objectID":"5ed777dfb9c82457e2b09b1c598f277b","permalink":"https://y2p.github.io/publication/2020nov/","publishdate":"2020-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020nov/","section":"publication","summary":"Novel Monte Carlo estimators are proposed to solve both the Tikhonov regularization (TR) and the interpolation problems on graphs. These estimators are based on random spanning forests (RSF), the theoretical properties of which enable to analyze the estimators' theoretical mean and variance. We also show how to perform hyperparameter tuning for these RSF-based estimators. TR is a component in many well-known algorithms, and we show how the proposed estimators can be easily adapted to avoid expensive intermediate steps in generalized semi-supervised learning, label propagation, Newton's method and iteratively reweighted least squares. In the experiments, we illustrate the proposed methods on several problems and provide observations on their run time.","tags":null,"title":"Graph Tikhonov Regularization and Interpolation via Random Spanning Forests","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusuf Yigit PILAVCI","Pierre-Olivier Amblard","Simon Barthelme","Nicolas Tremblay"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588291200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588291200,"objectID":"5a8efee0778b927ebd7cb3319f139ffa","permalink":"https://y2p.github.io/publication/2020may/","publishdate":"2020-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020may/","section":"publication","summary":"Another facet of the elegant link between random processes on graphs and Laplacian-based numerical linear algebra is uncovered: based on random spanning forests, novel Monte-Carlo estimators for graph signal smoothing are proposed.

Given a source graph with many labeled nodes and a target graph with few or no labeled nodes, we aim to estimate the target labels by making use of the similarity between the characteristics of the variation of the label functions on the two graphs. Our assumption about the source and the target domains is that the local behaviour of the label function, such as its spread and speed of variation on the graph, bears resemblance between the two graphs. We estimate the unknown target labels by solving an optimization problem where the label information is transferred from the source graph to the target graph based on the prior that the projections of the label functions onto localized graph bases be similar between the source and the target graphs. In order to efficiently capture the local variation of the label functions on the graphs, spectral graph wavelets are used as the graph bases. Experimentation on various data sets shows that the proposed method yields quite satisfactory classification accuracy compared to reference domain adaptation methods","tags":null,"title":"Graph Domain Adaptation with Localized Graph Signal Representations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yusuf Yigit PILAVCI","Nicolas Farrugia"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556668800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556668800,"objectID":"ae44f1864c1bc79571c472e849095179","permalink":"https://y2p.github.io/publication/2019may/","publishdate":"2019-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019may/","section":"publication","summary":"Graph Signal Processing has become a very useful framework for signal operations and representations defined on irregular domains. Exploiting transformations that are defined on graph models can be highly beneficial when the graph encodes relationships between signals. In this work, we present the benefits of using Spectral Graph Wavelet Transform (SGWT) as a feature extractor for machine learning on brain graphs. First, we consider a synthetic regression problem in which the smooth graph signals are generated as input with additive noise, and the target is derived from the input without noise. This enables us to optimize the spectrum coverage using different wavelet shapes. Finally, we present the benefits obtained by SGWT on a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) open dataset on human subjects, with several graphs and wavelet shapes, by demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to the state of the art.","tags":null,"title":"Spectral graph wavelet transform as feature extractor for machine learning in neuroimaging","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mehmet Turan","Yusuf Yigit PILAVCI","Ipek Ganiyusufoglu","Helder Araujo","Ender Konukoglu","Metin Sitti"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1512086400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1512086400,"objectID":"b4284648e2c3953c250e033729a15e39","permalink":"https://y2p.github.io/publication/2017dec/","publishdate":"2017-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2017dec/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Sparse-then-dense alignment-based 3d map reconstruction method for endoscopic capsule robots","type":"publication"}]
